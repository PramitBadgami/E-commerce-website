    <h1 style="font-size: 42px; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 40px; ">How Technology has affected today's world</h1>
    <img class="img" src="img/technology.jpg"><br><br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Technology is the branch of knowledge that is mostly used in day to day life. Technology is everything in today's world as one day without technolgy would cause a lot of loss and decline. Technology in particular is vastly used and utilized throughout the globe. technology is the utilization of logical information for various purposes, whether in industry or in our daily existences. Thus, fundamentally, at whatever point we utilize our logical information to accomplish some particular purpose, we are using technolgy. Technolgy is also the arrangement of information, abilities, expirience and methods through which people change and utilize our current circumstance to make changes in the world.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Technolgy has affected today's world as everyone is dependent on one or the other form of technology. The integration of technology make everything possible as there is endless possibility to it. Technology in itself is a very complicated yet very simple method to move forward. Technolgy currently is very vast but there are things yet to discovered. Currently technology has been moved ahead vastly as recently, a group of scientist were successful in intregrating a plant in the moon. There are Tesla cars which can travel automatically without a driver manually controllong it. Technology has been gearing up in terms of growth as there have been incorporation of Robotic Process Automation(RPA), Edge Computing, Quatum Computing, etc. Technology is developing at a quick speed, empowing faster change and progress, causing a increase in the pace of progress.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Technology has a huge impact in today's world as the world would literaly stop if technology vanishes. Technology is used in everything possible and impacting everyone's daily life. Every single one nowadays has a smartphone with them and it has been very essential to everybody. News, weather forcast, map has been very very useful and impactful. Technology also provides faster ways to communicate and deliver information. It affects the life of individuals and alters the method of their getting the hang of reasoning and correspondence. It assumes a significant part in the public eye and presently envisioning the existence without technology is extremely hard. Technology has also impacted in the overall growth of the world's GDP. There is no question that technology have fundamentally altered our perspective.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">While technology is moving vastly, it has its advantages and disadvantages. Technology helps us to keep in touch with the world's day to day news. Technology has been advanced so much that with one click on our cell-phones we can order food to the doormat, book tickets for movies, flights, etc. It also allows us to converse with people all around the world, share ideas, share data and information. Technology was also very useful when the whole world was in a disarray as the waves of Covid-19 came, everyone was locked in their houses. Then, technology played a huge part as students could take online classes, people could continue their job at home. These are some of the examples of advantanges of technology. While are alot of advantages of technology, there are plenty disadvantages as well. Technology has been the medium of war as creation of bombs, missiles, guns has resulted in bloodshed only. Technology also helped in the creation of huge trucks, buses which exhales alot of unhealthy gases which is very harmful for everybody.</p><br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Technology has a very bright future ahead. As the integration of Artificial Intelegence(AI) can prove to be one of them. AI can be the future of technology as it minimises human affords and maximizes carefree world. Industrial robots is also an emerging technology which can prove to be very decisive in the future. There are about 3.9 million robots in use and is expected to grow the even more and vastly. There are other new techologies that can be huge in the future such as Quantum, Graphene, Lifi, Smart Dust, the Metaverse and many more.</p>
